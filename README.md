Solar Apocalypse is a modpack focused on bringing you a reimagined and difficult experience. There are several features to enhance your experience, such as: a thirst system, a temperature system and mobs with completely new AI and full of new behaviors.

As well as focusing on difficulty, we bring all this together with a good list of mods and optimization resources that make your game weigh less and be much more efficient in performance.
