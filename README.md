**The Solar Apocalypse** is a modpack focused on bringing you a **reimagined and difficult** experience. There are several features to enhance your experience, such as: a **thirst system**, a **temperature system** and mobs with completely **new AI** and **full of new behaviors.**

As well as **focusing on difficulty**, we bring all this together with a good list of mods and **optimization resources** that make your game **weigh less** and be much **more efficient in performance.**

# ‚òÄÔ∏è The Sun's Burning Path
**These are the events that will occur in your gameplay:**

- **From the second day:** all the blocks (water, trees, grass and others) will be burned;
- **From the fourth day:** all the entities exposed to the sun will be burned;
- **From the fifteenth day:** all the entities and blocks will be burned from layer 100 (it no longer matters whether they are exposed to the sun or not);
- **Every 5 days:** the sun affects more layers until it reaches layer 0 on **day 100.**
