  - It's the same folder as the ``fabric-server-1.xx.x-0.1x.x.jar`` file.
  3. Go to ``pre-launch command`` and add this command: 
  ```
  java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar -g -s server https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seriousfreezing/SolarApocalypse/refs/heads/main/versions/supported/1.21.3/index.toml
  ```
